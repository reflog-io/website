# Why Reflog?

Reflog captures immutable operational events and continuously materializes them into Parquet projections.

You get both event history and current state from one ingest path. And because outputs are Parquet, your data is not trapped in Reflog; it plugs directly into DuckDB, Spark, Polars, DataFusion, warehouses, and lakehouse tooling.

Reflog is built for teams that need reliable event logging plus analytics-ready data, without taking on Kafka/Flink-level complexity on day one.

## 1. Problem statement

Event data is usually split across logs, OLTP tables, and ad-hoc pipelines.

Teams are forced to choose between:

- Easy ingest but hard analytics later
- Powerful analytics but heavy infrastructure upfront

Reflog closes that gap.

## 2. What Reflog gives you

- **Append-only ingest** for full auditability
- **Dual projections**
  - `_events`: complete event history
  - `_current`: latest entity state
- **Parquet-native output** for interoperability and query performance
- **Operational safety** through checkpoints, segmented processing, and crash recovery patterns

## 3. Architecture at a glance

1. gRPC ingest accepts entity operation events
2. Events are written to append-only segments
3. A background processor reads closed segments
4. Reflog writes Parquet projections (`_events`, `_current`) with compaction and partitioning

This keeps ingest simple while still producing trusted, analytics-friendly outputs.

## 4. Why Parquet matters

- **Columnar format**: efficient analytical scans on large datasets
- **Predicate pushdown and partition pruning**: faster queries, lower compute cost
- **Open standard**: no lock-in, easy downstream integration
- **Flexible workflows**: works for ad hoc analysis and scheduled pipelines

## 5. Use cases

- **Audit trails and compliance**: immutable record of creates/updates/deletes
- **Product analytics**: lifecycle and behavioral events ready for BI and SQL
- **Data lake ingestion edge**: operational events landed as query-ready Parquet
- **Entity snapshots**: `_current` projection for latest-truth tables
- **Backfill and replay**: deterministic projection rebuilds from the log
- **AI feature pipelines**: combine history and latest state as model inputs

## 6. When Reflog is a fit (and when it is not)

### Great fit

- Single-team to mid-scale event pipelines
- Internal platforms that need fast iteration
- Teams that want one ingest path for operations + analytics

### Not ideal (yet)

- Ultra-high-throughput, global multi-region streaming
- Complex exactly-once guarantees across many independent sinks
