# Backfill

This page is a placeholder for describing how to backfill historical events into Reflog.

## Common workflow

- Export historical state changes from your source system
- Convert into Reflog events (protobuf/JSON/etc.)
- Ingest in timestamp order
- Verify projections match expected state
